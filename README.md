# Automatic License Plate Recognition
## Project Objectives


## Software/Packages Used


## Algorithms & Methods Used
* License plate localization
  * Apply morphological operations to reveal possible license plate region.
  * Utilize contour properties to prune license plate candidates.

## Approaches
* The dataset is obtained from [Medialab group](http://www.medialab.ntua.gr/research/LPRdatabase.html), National Technical University of Athens in Greece.
* Assumptions made in this project:
  * The license plate text is always darker than the license plate background
  * The license plate itself is in a rectangular shape
  * Width of the license plate is longer than length of it.

## Results
### License Plate Localization
